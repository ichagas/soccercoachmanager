# 1. Vision
Create the simplest and most effective SaaS for competitive youth soccer coaches to:
- Track minimal but high-impact game statistics
- Identify development needs for teams and players
- Automatically generate weekly practice plans
- Manage multiple teams with consistency

The platform must be **fast, mobile-friendly, extremely simple**, and usable during a game.

# 2. Problem Statement
Youth soccer coaches today face:
- Overcomplicated analytics apps not suitable for live tracking
- No structured, consistent practice curriculum
- Difficulty managing multiple teams

Simple → fast → practical → real coaching impact.
